pfs(1) -- issue commands to a paranoid filesystem
=================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`pfs` `init`<br>
`pfs` `mount` <mountpoint><br>
`pfs` [`-n`|`--net`|`-f`|`--fuse`] `read` <file><br>
`pfs` [`-n`|`--net`|`-f`|`--fuse`] `creat` <file><br>
`pfs` [`-n`|`--net`|`-f`|`--fuse`] `write` <file> <offset> <length><br>

## DESCRIPTION

**pfs** is the control system for the paranoid file storage system. It handles 
communication between the network layers and FUSE and the virtual file system. 
It can also be used to manually test the file system by using commands without the 
`-n` or `-f`. 

## COMMANDS

* `init`:
    Create a new filesystem with the current directory on the host filesystem as the root.

* `mount`:
    Mount a paranoid filesystem and register it with FUSE. It will be mounted at <mountpoint>.

* `read`:
    Reads the file linked to by <file> and prints it to stdout (if called by the user) or to FUSE.

* `creat` <file>:
    Create a new file in the filesystem and create a hard link to it called <file>.
    
* `write` <file> <offset> <length>:
    Write the data piped in through stdin to the file referenced by <file> starting at <offset> and
    writing <length> bytes of data.

## OPTIONS

These options specify the source of the command.

  * `-n`, `--net`:
    The source of the command is the network. It is coming from another node. This
    flag instructs `pfs` not to send a message out on the network after performing the
    operation.

  * `-f`, `--fuse`:
    The source of the command is the FUSE layer. This flag instructs `pfs` to send a message
    out on the network after performing the operation.
    
These options specify the output of the program.

  * `-v`, `--verbose`:
    This enables debug logging. 

These options are miscellaneous options.

  * `--version`:
    Show pfs version and exit.
    
## EXAMPLES

Create new file with primary link name of `helloworld.txt` and write the text "Hello World!"

    $ pfs creat helloworld.txt
    $ echo "Hello World!" | pfs write helloworld.txt 0 13
    $ pfs read helloworld.txt
    Hello World!
